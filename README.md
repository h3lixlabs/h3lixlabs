- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, We're @h3lixlabs
- ðŸ‘€ Learn about our carrier oil, Miglyol 840. The good, high end stuff. It's so thin, you can take your shot with an insulin needle. It is PIP free and can hold high concentrations of short esters like Primo at 250mg/ml or NPP at 250mg/ml.

- ðŸŒ± Cultivate your understanding with this industry data sheet...
- ðŸ“« For the 3.8 % who have an adverse PIP like irritation at the injection site, you are ALLERGIC to Miglyol.  Please have your Helix Rep contact us for an MCT carrier based replacement.
